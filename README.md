<h1>sign-addon no-dependencies</h1>
github.com/mozilla/sign-addon with all the dependencies included, <br/>
and a more simplified example, <br/>
and a helpful CMD-batch file to wrap the NodeJS functionality. <br/>
<br/>
JWT_ISSUER and JWT_SECRET are stored in txt files (dummy values included). <br/>
You need to generate your own credentials and run the 'example.cmd'. <br/>
(Delete it afterwards from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/developers/addon/nothing/versions ).
