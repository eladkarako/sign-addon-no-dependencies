# sign-addon-no-dependencies
github.com/mozilla/sign-addon with all the dependencies included, and a more simplified example, and a helpful CMD-batch file to wrap the NodeJS functionality. JWT_ISSUER and JWT_SECRET are stored in txt files (dummy values included). You need to generate your own credentials and run the 'example.cmd'. (Delete it afterwards from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/developers/addon/nothing/versions ).
